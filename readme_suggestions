This is a great gem truly.
But I would like to ask for modifying the Readme file.
Under `How It Works` and then uder Ruby section you just wrote
   `ahoy.track "Viewed book", title: "Hot, Flat, and Crowded"`
Which is very confusing about where to add this code whether 
this should be added in model or in controller or in every 
action of the controller.
I am writing because I found that, a lot of developer 
are seriously confused about the place to add this code 
and you will find many questions regarding that at
stackoverflow as well.
So please update the readme file add the location of the code to 
put on for both Javascript and Ruby.

That will be very helpfull for everyone.
